# Applied Machine Learning | Fall 2024
This repository contains code implementations and analysis done in the Applied Machine Learning course during Fall 2024. The course focuses on practical applications of machine learning techniques, exploring various algorithms, tools, and approaches to solve real-world data-driven problems. The objective of the course is to understand machine learning algorithms to solve structured and unstructured data problems, and address challenges in model training, such as overfitting, underfitting, and class imbalance. The repository is organized into the following key notebooks:

1. **Linear_Models_SVMs.ipynb**  
   Implementation and analysis of linear models and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for classification and regression tasks.
